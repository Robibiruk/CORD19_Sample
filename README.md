## Overview

This project is a **comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 research papers** using the CORD-19 dataset. The goal was to explore and visualize patterns in the dataset and build an interactive **Streamlit web application** to make the insights accessible in a dynamic and user-friendly way.  

It demonstrates **data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and machine learning classification** skills in Python.

## Features

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection
- Load the sample CORD-19 metadata CSV file using `pandas`.
- Explore the dataset shape, column types, and missing values.
- Preview the first few rows of data directly in the web app.

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Handle missing data in numeric and categorical columns.
- Convert publication dates to datetime and extract `publish_year`.
- Create new features:
  - `abstract_word_count`
  - `title_word_count`
  - `num_authors`
- Reduce journal categories to top publishers for better analysis.

### 3️⃣ Visualizations
- **Publications Over Time:** Interactive bar chart showing number of papers per year since 1990.
- **Top Journals:** Horizontal bar chart of the 10 most prolific journals publishing COVID-19 papers.
- **Word Cloud of Titles:** Most frequent words in paper titles to highlight research trends.
- **Distribution by Source:** Cleaned bar chart showing top sources of papers plus an 'Other' category.

### 4️⃣ Abstract Length Classification
- Classify abstracts as **short vs long** based on word count using a **Random Forest Classifier**.
- Features include:
  - `publish_year`
  - `title_word_count`
  - `num_authors`
  - One-hot encoded top journals
- Outputs in the app:
  - Cross-validated accuracy
  - Classification report
  - Confusion matrix
  - Feature importance plot
  - Predicted probabilities scatter and histogram
  - Correlation heatmap of numeric features

### 5️⃣ Interactive Streamlit Application
- Built a **fully interactive dashboard** using Streamlit.
- Displayed tables, plots, and word clouds dynamically.
- Users can explore the dataset visually without running code locally.
- Clean, intuitive layout suitable for presentations or reports.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Python Programming:** Data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering.
- **Data Analysis:** Handling missing values, descriptive statistics, numerical and categorical processing.
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud for clear, interpretable plots.
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest for classification, model evaluation (cross-validation, confusion matrix, feature importance).
- **Web App Development:** Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration.
- **Data Communication:** Translating data insights into interactive visuals and concise reports.

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [CORD-19 Research Challenge - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)
- **File Used:** `metadata.csv` (or a sampled version for performance)
- Contains:
  - Paper titles and abstracts
  - Publication dates
  - Authors and journals
  - Source information

> Note: The full CORD-19 dataset is very large. This project uses a sampled dataset for fast exploration and deployment.
